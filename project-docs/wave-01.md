# Wave 01: Presentational Component

**Learn Topics: React Components and Props required for this wave**

Update the `ChatEntry` and `App` components to display a 
single chat message bubble with the message text and 
relative timestamp, plus 
the sender's name above it.  

A good way to test this code as you write it would be to take the first chat message from the [JSON data file](../src/data/messages.json) and use it as the data for the `ChatEntry` component.

`ChatEntry` should have props which match the elements from each chat message in the JSON data file: `sender`, `body`,  and `timeStamp`.

Note: We do not need to include the `id` and `liked` fields for Wave 01. Additionally, you should not build your own logic to handle converting the absolute value of `timeStamp` to a relative value for display. Please refer to the [setup docs](./setup.md#hint-the-timestamp-component) for tips about how to utilize the `TimeStamp` component already provided.

## Imports

Remember that the values we need for building the proptypes definitions come from an external library which must be imported. We'll also need to be sure to import any other components used in each file. In general, we need to make sure that we keep track of our imports as we work through the project. 

## Styling

The styles necessary to make an app which visually matches the demo above have been provided for you, but you will need to make use of them in your React components by adding classes to specific HTML elements in your JSX.

There are several CSS classes for the different elements of a chat message. You should attempt to determine which classes should be applied to which HTML elements yourself. However, if you are stuck on this, please reach out for help as the styling is not the primary learning goal of this project.

Usually our convention for styles in React applications is to have a separate CSS file for every component. 

**NOTE**: Unless you are working on the optional enhancement, make sure that your chat message's container element has both the classes "chat-entry" and "local".

## Tests

This component has a set of tests that ensure that props passed to the component appear in the browser. To pass the tests, the component must be named `ChatEntry` with props `sender`, `body`,  and `timeStamp`.
